Eyes are inserted into the DOM and follow the users mouse. The onmousemove event is being used to track the mouse, which then transforms the eyes so that they "follow" the mouse. There are no additional steps for the user to make, as simply moving the mouse causes the intended effect. Users can download the source files and open the index.html file in their browser to see the eye movement exercise. 

In the future, I'd like to add a transformation button that changes the eyes once clicked to a different color/shape.
